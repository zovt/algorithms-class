\section{The Interval Scheduling Again}
This approach is a greedy since it tries to make the locally optimal choice
with each interval selection, i.e., it picks the one with the last start time
that does not conflict with any of the others with the hope that by doing this
repeatedly we arrive at a globally optimal solution.

This does, in fact, yield an optimal solution. Let $I$ be a set of intervals.
We first pick an interval $I_1$ with start time $S_1$ such that $S_1$ is 
greater than all other start times. Then, we let $I'$ be a subset of $I$ such
that no intervals in $I'$ intersect with $I_1$. We repeat the process using 
$I'$, and continue repeating in this way until no intervals are left.

Thus, in essence, we are picking intervals that begin closest to the maximum
end time $E_{max}$ of $I$ and do not overlap any of our currently chosen 
intervals. The fact that we are choosing the interval with the start time 
closest to the maximum end time means that there can be other interval or
combination of intervals that do not intersect our current choices and minimize
the distance between their start time and the max end time. That is to say,
choosing in this way will give us the maximum number of non-ovelapping 
intervals in a given set of intervals.

\section{Connected Components}
In an undirected graph, a connected component is any maximal set of vertices
with paths between them, i.e., there can only be more than one connected
component if there are two vertices with no edge between them.

Thus, if you have an undirected graph with $n$ vertices, with $k$ connected
components, drawing an edge from any connected component to any other will
increase the edge count e by 1 and decrease the number of connected components 
by 1. Thus, if $n - k \geq e$, then $n - (k - 1) \geq e + 1$ and the inequality
holds since we have balanced it via subtracting one from the left and adding 
one to the right.
